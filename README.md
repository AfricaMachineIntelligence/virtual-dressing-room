#Virtual Dressing Room
---

The idea of Virtual Dressing Room is to provide the customer with the experience of dressing virtually of the garments he/she wishes to buy. Here we present a system that allows users to interactively control a model of themselves at the Virtual Dressing Room using the concept of Virtual Mirror. As a result, users can enjoy a private, Virtual try-on experience in the virtual changing rooms without actually trying the clothes
